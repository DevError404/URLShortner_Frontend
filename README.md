# URLShortner_Frontend
This is a URL shortner service Angular. For the API and backend side you can check my another repo as "UrlShortner_Backend" made in nodejs, MongoDB, Express.js. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
